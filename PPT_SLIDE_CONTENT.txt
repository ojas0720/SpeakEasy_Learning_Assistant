=== SLIDE 13: PRONUNCIATION ALGORITHM ===
How Pronunciation Matching Works

Levenshtein Distance Algorithm:

Step 1: User speaks the paragraph
Step 2: Web Speech API captures voice
Step 3: Normalize text (lowercase, remove accents)
Step 4: Split into individual words
Step 5: Compare each word using Levenshtein distance
Step 6: Calculate similarity percentage
Step 7: Mark word complete if similarity ≥ 60%
Step 8: Update progress bar and visual feedback

Algorithm Complexity:
• Time Complexity: O(m × n)
• Space Complexity: O(m × n)
• Where m, n are string lengths

Accuracy:
• 60% threshold balances strictness and forgiveness
• Handles accent variations
• Works across all languages

=== SLIDE 14: AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM ===
Dual Authentication Architecture

Two Separate Systems:

User Authentication (Clerk):
• OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)
• Email/Password authentication
• Session management
• User profile management
• Social login support

Admin Authentication (Custom JWT):
• Username/Password login
• JWT token-based sessions
• 24-hour session duration
• Separate login page
• Independent from user system

Why Two Systems?
• Security: Admin isolated from users
• Flexibility: Different requirements
• Control: Custom admin features
• Scalability: Independent scaling

Levenshtein Distance Algorithm

function levenshtein(a: string, b: string) {
  const m = a.length;
  const n = b.length;
  const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, 
    () => new Array(n + 1).fill(0));
  
  for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) dp[i][0] = i;
  for (let j = 0; j <= n; j++) dp[0][j] = j;
  
  for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
      const cost = a[i - 1] === b[j - 1] ? 0 : 1;
      dp[i][j] = Math.min(
        dp[i - 1][j] + 1,
        dp[i][j - 1] + 1,
